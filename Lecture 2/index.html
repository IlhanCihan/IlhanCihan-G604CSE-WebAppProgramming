            <p class="col-md-6">Student engagement is widely recognised as an important influence on achievement and
                learning in higher
                education and as such is being widely theorised and researched. This article firstly reviews and
                critiques
                the four dominant research perspectives on student engagement: the behavioural perspective, which
                foregrounds student behaviour and institutional practice; the psychological perspective, which clearly
                defines engagement as an individual psycho-social process; the socio-cultural perspective, which
                highlights
                the critical role of the socio-political context; and, finally, the holistic perspective, which takes a
                broader view of engagement. Key problems are identified, in particular poor definitions and a lack of
                distinction between the state of engagement, factors that influence student engagement, and the
                immediate
                and longer term consequences of engagement. The second part of the article presents a conceptual
                framework
                that overcomes these problems, incorporating valuable elements from each of the perspectives, to enable
                a better shared understanding of student engagement to frame future research and improve student
                outcomes.

                The Hofburg Palace is the former principal imperial palace of the Habsburg dynasty. Located in the
                center of Vienna, it was built in the 13th century and expanded several times. Empress Maria Theresa had
                a 17th-century opera house converted into the dance and concert halls now known as the Redoutensäle,
                forming the Redoute Wing. This 1763 oil painting by Martin van Meytens depicts the hall on the occasion
                of the wedding supper of Princess Isabella of Parma and Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who were married
                on 5 October 1760.
                The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the largest. It has pioneered
                many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some
                of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",[7] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[8]
                navigation templates,[9] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[10] dispute
                resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[11] and weekly collaborations.[12]
